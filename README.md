# Student-Information-MySQL-Project
- Project Overview
  - The Student Information System is a database-driven project built using MySQL to manage and organize student-related data efficiently.
  - This project is designed for learning and practice purposes, focusing on database design, SQL queries, and relational data handling.
  - It simulates how educational institutions store and manage information such as students, courses, enrollments, and results.
 
---------------------------------------

- 🎯 Objectives
  - Practice MySQL database design
  - Understand relationships between tables
  - Perform CRUD operations using SQL
  - Write optimized SQL queries
  - Learn real-world database structure
 
------------------------------------------

- 🛠️ Technologies Used
  - Database: MySQL
  - Query Language: SQL
  - Tool: MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin / Command Line
  - Version Control: Git & GitHub

   ---------------------------------------

- 🗂️ Database Structure
  - The project consists of multiple related tables to store structured student data.
  - Example Tables:
  - students – Stores student personal details
  - courses – Stores course information
  - enrollments – Manages student-course relationships
  - departments – Stores department details
  - results / grades – Stores student performance data
- (Table names may vary based on your implementation)

  ----------------------------------------------------

- 🔗 Relationships
  - One student can enroll in multiple courses
  - One course can have multiple students
  - Each student belongs to one department
  - Enrollment table acts as a bridge (Many-to-Many relationship)
